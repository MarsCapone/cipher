Cipher 
======

Encrypts and decrypts classical ciphers, using Java.

Interested in ciphers so just created this and previously created a similar program in Python. Just started Java in CS, so thought I would make the program again in Java. Hopefully using better code, and faster, and with a GUI and full command line interface.

***

**Currently implemented ciphers**:

* Atbash: encryption and decryption (there is only one key)
* ROT13: encryption and decryption (there is only one key)
* Caesar Shift: encryption and decryption, with a key or force search
* Substitution Cipher: encryption and decryption with a key

**Planned Ciphers**:

* Vigenere
* Autokey
* Beaufort
* Affine
* Hill
* Unknown (attempts decryption even if the cipher is unknown)
