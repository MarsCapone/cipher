Cipher 
======

Encrypts and decrypts classical ciphers, using Java.

Interested in ciphers so just created this and previously created a similar program in Python. Just started Java in CS, so thought I would make the program again in Java. Hopefully using better code, and faster, and with a GUI and full command line interface.

***

**Currently implemented ciphers**:

* Caesar Shift: encryption, decryption (with a key or force search)
* Substitution Cipher: encryption, decryption (with a key)

**Planned Ciphers**:

* Vigenere
* Autokey
* Beaufort
* Hill
* Atbash
* Affine
* Unknown (attempts decryption even if the cipher is unknown)
